# Purpose of app/resources folder

In this folder and sub folders are the "raw" resources located, such as images or sound assets.

During the Grunt workflow, these resources are copied to `app/assets/generated` folder / `dist` folder and, if required, processed (e.g., Sprite generation with `Compass`).
